# Proposal

# What will (likely) be the title of your project?
"PONG with a "FRIEND"

# In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
My project will allow for a user controlled paddle and an AI controlled paddle to play a game of pong. The result shall be a fair and equal game with a winner.

# In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project will include a game called Pong which gives us control of two paddles that try and deflect a ball at all times. My project will include LOVE and Lua programming language.
I will use code to try and make the game as fair as possible as I seen an example in my programming class. The code should be a small piece but be explainale and understandable.
It's important that the AI controlled paddle moves in relation to the ball. 

# If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

# If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.
Currently, I still do not have classmates to help which means I might end up doing this project on my own. 


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

# In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
A good outcome for my final project is one that will have either one paddle or both paddles deflect the ball which means it will have to move in relation to the ball.

# In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I think the better outcome for the final project would be if both paddles could try and move to deflect the ball which might be more difficult for me to achieve. However, I will try my best.
#In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I hope for the final project to have both paddles play a very competitive game. This could be of great amusement and interest for anyone who stumbles across my final project.

# In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
I need to look over the Lua programming language as well as acquire a lot more skills for this project. I plan to give it my all, looking up how to control the paddle size and movement and
make the game amusing and fast. I've never done anything like this before so it will definitely be a challenge for me. If I do get a classmate to help, I would like for the both of us to help
each other in every way possible. It would be amazing if I could code the control of one paddle while my classmate code and control the movement of the other paddle.
